## Mi Card

A clean, minimal digital business card application built with Flutter. This repository contains the source code for a small mobile app that shows a personal card with name, title, contact details and links — a lightweight starting point you can customize and reuse.

## Features

- Clean and responsive single-screen UI
- Shows name, role/title, phone, email and links
- Ready for quick customization (colors, fonts, content)
- Small and easy-to-read codebase — great for beginners learning Flutter
